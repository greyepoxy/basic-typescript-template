## Conways game of life
Today we'll be working on Conway's game of life.

The game is a cellular automaton, where cells live or die according to a set of four rules:



Births: Each dead cell adjacent to exactly three live neighbors will become live in the next generation.
Death by isolation: Each live cell with one or fewer live neighbors will die in the next generation.
Death by overcrowding: Each live cell with four or more live neighbors will die in the next generation.
Survival: Each live cell with either two or three live neighbors will remain alive for the next generation.


Here is a working example to play around with
